# Minimum fluidisation velocities in a gas-fluidised bed composed of sand with added silicon oil
#
# Experimentally measured at the University of Birmingham by Dominik Werner
#
# Adding oil to a fluidised bed affects its minimum fluidisation velocity (UMF). The data columns
# represent the oil loading (wt%), viscosity, standard deviation across 3 repeats, and measured
# UMF. SI units used.
